Field
=====

An audiovisual PureData library used in "Playing the Field" installation by Nicholas Houde and myself.

"Description:

Using video data, we will use created software to aggregate the velocity of movement in the space which will generate a sound sequence adjusted in ratio to the velocity.  This means that the sound will be tempo adjusted to match the aggregated velocity of the room - moving from a still drone to something of a 180bpm techno track all depending on what is occurring in the space.  The data will be interpreted by a video camera and a series of hardware/software combinations.  The sound will be played through a basic stereo or series of speakers ideally surrounding the room.  A short, elucidative description will be available for participants."
